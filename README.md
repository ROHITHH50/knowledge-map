Knowledge Map Project
Welcome to the Knowledge Map Project! This project is a visualization tool that helps display various courses and their relationships in a circular graph using Cytoscape.js. It's designed to show how different topics in robotics and software development connect, making it easier to understand the structure of learning.

📝 Overview
The Knowledge Map organizes various courses into a visually interactive map. It covers foundational topics like ROS2, robotics theory, programming languages, and much more. This is useful for learners who want a clear, easy-to-follow roadmap of what they need to learn and how everything is interrelated.

🚀 Features
Interactive Graph: Courses and topics are represented as nodes, and their relationships are shown as edges.
Circular Layout: All the nodes are placed in a circular arrangement, allowing for easy navigation between topics.
Vue.js and Cytoscape: Built using Vue.js for the frontend and Cytoscape.js for graph visualization.
🔧 Installation Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/ROHITHH50/knowledge-map.git
2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm.

bash
Copy code
cd knowledge-map
npm install
3. Run the Project Locally
After installing the dependencies, you can run the project on your local machine.

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
This will start a local server and you should be able to view the Knowledge Map in your browser

📄 Usage
Once the project is up and running:

Interactive Graph: Click on any course node to see the related topics. The graph will highlight these connections to make it easier for you to navigate.
Explore: You can zoom in and out of the graph to get a better view of all the interconnected topics.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Vue.js: A JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
Cytoscape.js: A graph theory library that is used to render the knowledge map.
npm: A package manager used to install dependencies.
